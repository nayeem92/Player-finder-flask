## Project: Player Finder Flask

• Developed a cloud-based application using machine learning clustering for player similarity identification in EPL.

• Created a dynamic web app with a pre-tuned model for continuous adaptability based on updated data.

• Utilized Flask, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for efficient data processing with K-Means clustering in the backend.

• Utilized Joblib to load and manage the pre-trained model, seamlessly integrating a player analysis algorithm.

• Integrated Plotly and Seaborn for enhanced data visualization and an improved user experience.

• https://cron-job.org/en/ used to keep the webapp running on the cloud.
